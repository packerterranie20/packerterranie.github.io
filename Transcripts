My name is Terranie Packer. I am from Moss Point, Mississippi and I am a recent graduate of Resurrection Catholic High School. Here I held many leadership positions in my community, was a member of various service organizations, clubs, and church. In the fall of 2016, I will be an incoming freshman at Tougaloo College. Words that describe me are outgoing, dedicated, and determined.
